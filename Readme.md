Token Counter System
Overview
Welcome to the Token Counter System project! This repository contains the implementation of a Token Counter System developed as part of an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) lab assignment. The project showcases the practical application of OOP principles to create a system for managing and servicing tokens.

Features
Object-Oriented Design: Utilizes classes and objects to model the token counter system.
Modular Code: Each component of the system is encapsulated within its respective class.
Scalability: The system is designed to be easily extendable for additional functionalities.
Implementation Details
The Token Counter System is implemented in C++ and consists of the following main components:

Classes
Token: Represents individual tokens with unique identifiers.
ServiceCounter: Manages the collection of tokens and provides methods for generating, assigning, and servicing tokens.
Key Functions
generateToken(): Adds a new token to the system.
assignToken(): Assigns a token to a service counter.
serviceToken(): Services the assigned token.
initializeServiceCounter(): Initializes the service counter.
